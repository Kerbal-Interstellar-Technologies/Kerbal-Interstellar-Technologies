KSPI 1.7.0 Released on 2016-03-28


    Added Magneto Inertial Fusion Rocket Engine (Artist nli2work)
    Added Tokamak Engine, which Combines Fusion Reactor with integrated Magnetic Nozzle (Credits for SilverSilver for re-texture)
    Added XI Fusion Reactor which combines a Magnetic Confinement Reactor with Direct Energy Converter
    Added Half Size Wrap Radiator (Artist PorkJet)
    Added 4 additional tech-level to Interstellar Radiators which are unlock by CTT heat management tech nodes
    Moved initial ViSTA engine to exotic fusion
    Improve Compatibility with Navigation tools like MechJeb and Better Burn prediction (Thanks to RxTen1)
    Increased Isp of open cycle Gas Core Reactor
    Increased Maximum WArp speed to 1000 time speed of light
    Thermal Nozzle with Isp higher than 3000s will function as a magnetic nozzle and therefore will not be effective withing atmospheres
    Science Lab now requires Megawatt power to convert science data into research data
    Mass Energy Generator depends on Power output reactor and Technology
    Direct Energy Converter now requires High Tech Electric Systems to be unlocked
    Increased Volume Fusion Reactor, Increased Mass and Reduced Initial Power Output
    Fusion Reactors now has up to 5 tech-levels
    Merged Dumbo and Solid Core Reactor (NERVA) which now has 5 tech levels
    Reduced Initial Power Output Pebble Bed Reactor but added 2 additional tech levels
    Fusion Mode proton-Boron11 now required Exotic Fusion Tech
    Darkened Wrapped Radiators

1.7.3

* Added Interstellar Wrapped Tanks which can be ejected, ideal for launches
* Added Curved Graphite Radiators and Edge
* Fixed some log error message in VAB
* Depending on Nozzle type, Antimatter reactor will perform either as Gas Core or Plasma Antimatter reactor
* Balance: Reduced Antimatter reactor maximum problem
* Improved Antimatter  Fuel Efficiency
* Improved responsiveness Thermal Launch nozzle
