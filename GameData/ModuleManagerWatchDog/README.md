Module Manager is a Watch Dog to monitor Module Manager, preventing known (and unsolved) bugs on KSP 1.8 and newer that affects it.

Besides not needed, you can use Module Manager Watch Dog on KSP <= 1.7.3 - it will just dry run without doing anything.

This tool is aimed to be redistributed embedded on Add'Ons that used to redistribute Module Manager themselves in the past, unintentionally triggering the problems this tool aims to detect.

Detailed installation instructions are now on its own file (see the [In a Hurry](#in-a-hurry) section) and on the distribution file.
