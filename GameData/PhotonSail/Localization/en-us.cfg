	#autoLOC_aluminiumPhotonSail_part_title = Aluminium Photon Sail
	#autoLOC_aluminiumPhotonSail_part_description = Photon sails (also called light sails or solar sails) are a form of spacecraft propulsion using the radiation pressure (also called solar pressure) from stars to push large ultra-thin mirrors to high speeds. Although Aluminium reflectance in infrared is not as good as Gold, it can partially operate in the ultraviolet spectrum.
	
	#autoLOC_dielectricPhotonSail_part_title = Dielectectic Photon Sail
	#autoLOC_dielectricPhotonSail_part_description = Photon sails (also called light sails or solar sails) are a form of spacecraft propulsion using the radiation pressure (also called solar pressure) from light to push large ultra-thin mirrors to high speeds. This Dielectric photon sail has a 99.998% reflectance in the Near Infrared spectrum, making it ideal for Beamed Phased Laser propulsion from Kerbin surface. This comes at the expense of reduced reflectance in the visible and longer infrared spectrum, making it less flexible and suitable for solar sailing.
	#autoLOC_dielectricPhotonSail_Upgrades_title = Dielectric Photon Sail Efficiency
	#autoLOC_dielectricPhotonSail_Upgrades_description = When researched will make dielectric  photon more relective.

	#autoLOC_solarSail_part_title = Gold Photon Sail
	#autoLOC_solarSail_part_description = Photon sails (also called light sails or solar sails) are a form of spacecraft propulsion using the radiation pressure (also called solar pressure) from stars to push large ultra-thin mirrors to high speeds. This Gold Photon Sail has optimized reflectivity in long infrared, allowing it to endure very high beamed power amounts from KSC ground based laser transmitters.
	#autoLOC_solarSail_Upgrades_title = Photon Sail Mass Reduction
	#autoLOC_solarSail_Upgrades_description = When researched will make photon sails lighter.
	
	#autoLOC_ThinFilmSolarCellSail_part_title = Thin-film solar cell sail
	#autoLOC_ThinFilmSolarCellSail_part_description = Photon sails (also called light sails or solar sails) are a form of spacecraft propulsion using the radiation pressure (also called solar pressure) from stars to push large ultra-thin mirrors to high speeds. Although Aluminium reflectance in infrared is not as good as Gold, it can partially operate in the ultraviolet spectrum.
