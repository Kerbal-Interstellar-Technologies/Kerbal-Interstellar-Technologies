	description = Photon sails (also called light sails or solar sails) are a form of spacecraft propulsion using the radiation pressure (also called solar pressure) from stars to push large ultra-thin mirrors to high speeds. Although Aluminium reflectance in infrared is not as good as Gold, it can partially operate in the ultraviolet spectrum.
