		#LOC_KSPIE_AntimatterCollector_title = Antimatter Collector
		#LOC_KSPIE_AntimatterCollector_manuf = Zefram Kerman's Warp Supplies Co.
		#LOC_KSPIE_AntimatterCollector_descr = Harvests antimatter from planetary magnetospheres.  The rate at which antimatter acquisition occurs is dependent upon the magnetic field strength of the planet in question.
		#LOC_KSPIE_TweakableAntimatterReactor_title = Plasma Beam Core Antimatter Reactor
		#LOC_KSPIE_TweakableAntimatterReactor_manuf = Zefram Kerman's Warp Supplies Co.
		#LOC_KSPIE_TweakableAntimatterReactor_descr = This Antimatter reactor can function either as a plasma core or beam core antimatter reactor, depending on what nozzle is used.
		#LOC_KSPIE_FNFissionFusionCatReactorMk1_title = Antimatter Initiated Micro Fusion Reactor
		#LOC_KSPIE_FNFissionFusionCatReactorMk1_manuf = Geomax Plc.
		#LOC_KSPIE_FNFissionFusionCatReactorMk1_descr = An Antimatter Initated Fission/Fusion Reactor that uses small quantities of antiprotons to produce fission in Uranium nuclei which in turn provide the energy to ignite fusion in a Deuterium/Helium-3 pellet.  The reactor contains the antiprotons magnetically and electrostatically in a vacuum.  This requires fewer bulky components compared to Tokomak designs but does require a healthy supply of antimatter to operate for long periods.
		#LOC_KSPIE_DPFFReactor_title = Dusty Plasma Fission Fragment Reactor
		#LOC_KSPIE_DPFFReactor_manuf = Radiant Future Enterprises
		#LOC_KSPIE_DPFFReactor_descr = The Dusty Plasma fission-fragment rocket is a rocket engine design that directly harnesses hot nuclear fission products for thrust, as opposed to using a separate fluid as working mass. The design can, in theory, produce very high specific impulse while still being well within the abilities of current technologies. The reactor is a Dusty Plasma design capable of producing a high proportion of its power as charged particles. To use for propulsion, connect the reactor to a Magnetic Nozzle and a thermal electric generator to produce the electricity to power the Magnetic nozzle magnets.
		#LOC_KSPIE_FIRGaCo_title = Open Cycle Gas Core Fission Reactor
		#LOC_KSPIE_FIRGaCo_manuf = Radiant Future Enterpirses
		#LOC_KSPIE_FIRGaCo_descr = The Open Cycle Gas Core reactor excel a generating high amount of thermal power at double the core temperatures the Closed Cycle predecessor with less mass. This is achieved my removing the walls that separate the propellant and the nuclear fuel. Although this allows much higher core temperatures, the disadvantage is the reactor cannot operate while under the influence of acceleration, which happens when it is either on he surface or when accelerating at high speed.
		#LOC_KSPIE_FutureFusionReactor_title = IXS Magnetic Confinement Fusion Reactor
		#LOC_KSPIE_FutureFusionReactor_manuf = WarpTech Industries
		#LOC_KSPIE_FutureFusionReactor_descr = Advanced Fusion Reactor with integrated Direct Energy Converter.
		#LOC_KSPIE_KspiIXSWarpRing_title = Alcubierre Drive (Heavy)
		#LOC_KSPIE_KspiIXSWarpRing_manuf = WarpTech Industries
		#LOC_KSPIE_KspiIXSWarpRing_descr = As the WarpTech marketing department says, "Why go places, when you can bring places to you?" Before engaging the drive, make sure to have a good supply of Warp Plasma, as well as a large amount of electricity.
		#LOC_KSPIE_FURMagTar_title = Magnetized Target Fusion Reactor
		#LOC_KSPIE_FURMagTar_manuf = Radiant Future Enterpirses
		#LOC_KSPIE_FURMagTar_descr = Magnetised Target Fusion Reactor can be smaller than the MCF reactor, but it is limited to providing thermal power. This makes it ideal for build SSTO vessels which require large amount of thermal heat to generate thrust when connected with any thermal nozzle. It can also be used for Electric Power production, but it requires a large amount of radiators to be effective.
		#LOC_KSPIE_FURMaCoSt_title = Stellarator Fusion Reactor 
		#LOC_KSPIE_FURMaCoSt_manuf = Radiant Future Enterpirses
		#LOC_KSPIE_FURMaCoSt_descr = The stellarator is a advanced magnetic containment fusion reactor which is havier but more efficient than the Spherical Tokamak. Similarly to tokamak designs, this reactor contains a (hopefully) controlled nuclear fusion reaction inside a magnetic field. However, the stellarator is of a figure-eight geometry that allows the magnetic containment to more effectively counteract drift of the particles in the containment field. All those weirdly shaped magnets mean that it's got a bit more mass to it and as such it is best suited for powering beam-powered networks from surface or stationary orbits. This design has been pioneered by Spitzer Kerman, who claims that his invention was definitely NOT an accidental squishing of a regular tokamak reactor, honest. 
		#LOC_KSPIE_FURMaCoTo_title = MFC Spherical Tokamak
		#LOC_KSPIE_FURMaCoTo_manuf = Radiant Future Enterpirses
		#LOC_KSPIE_FURMaCoTo_descr = The Sperical Tokamak is Magnetic Confinement Fusion Reactor is one of the first Fusion Power reactor and comes available with Fusion Power. This reactor is big, bulky and requires a fixed amount of power to operate - but it can be used for wide variety of purposes. The amount of power required depends on the type of fusion and the number of researched fusion technology science nodes. MCF is most suitable for fuel efficient and thermal efficient power production. One of the big advantage of fusion is that its fuel can be very cheap, relatively easy to store and has only low amounts of radioactive waste products. The fusion products themselves can be directly converted into electric power, which allows the reactor to be very energy efficient. Initial Minimum Size is 5 m, but after advanced fusion, it can be scaled down to 3.75 diameter, and with exotic fusion to 2.5 diameter 
		#LOC_KSPIE_MHDGenerator_title = Magnetohydrodynamic Electric Generator
		#LOC_KSPIE_MHDGenerator_manuf = Brayton Kerman's Power Parts Inc.
		#LOC_KSPIE_MHDGenerator_descr = A Direct Conversion Generator that turns charged particles into electrical power.
		#LOC_KSPIE_MoltenSaltReactor_title = Molten Salt Reactor
		#LOC_KSPIE_MoltenSaltReactor_manuf = Kerbin Electric Inc.
		#LOC_KSPIE_MoltenSaltReactor_descr = Molten Salt Fission Reactors have the lowest temperature and thermal power of all the reactors, but these drawbacks are balanced out with their long-lasting stores of UF4 or ThF4. This fission reactor can last a very long time without refueling. The actinide waste can also be reprocessed using a refinery or a science lab to vastly increase their lifespan, and the reactors can even be refueled to extend it indefinitely. The fission reaction requires a minimum power level to sustain itself, and so these reactors cannot go below 20% power production unless they are shut off.
		#LOC_KSPIE_KspiPebbleBed_title = Pebble Bed Reactor
		#LOC_KSPIE_KspiPebbleBed_manuf = Radiant Future Enterprises
		#LOC_KSPIE_KspiPebbleBed_descr = Part of a new series of fission reactors with slightly different capabilities.  The flagship "Akula" reactor provides tremendous power output, which operates up to potentially higher themperatures than Molten Salt designs but has a power output that is inversely related to temperature.
		#LOC_KSPIE_PlasmaJetMagnetoInertialReactor_title = Plasma Jet Magneto Inertial Fusion Reactor
		#LOC_KSPIE_PlasmaJetMagnetoInertialReactor_manuf = Radiant Future Enterpirses
		#LOC_KSPIE_PlasmaJetMagnetoInertialReactor_descr = Magnetised Target Fusion Reactor can be smaller than the MCF reactor, but it is limited to providing thermal power. This makes it ideal for build SSTO vessels which require large amount of thermal heat to generate thrust when connected with any thermal nozzle. It can also be used for Electric Power production, but it requires a large amount of radiators to be effective. 
		#LOC_KSPIE_KspiQuantumSingulaityReactor2_title = DT-R-QS-1 Quantum Singularity Reactor
		#LOC_KSPIE_KspiQuantumSingulaityReactor2_manuf = DragonTek
		#LOC_KSPIE_KspiQuantumSingulaityReactor2_descr = The ultimate in power generation. The artificial black hole is generated by accelerating exotic matter in rings that are magnetically suspended inside the reactor core. A Quantum Singularity Reactor uses a microscopic black hole to convert matter into energy. The lighter the atoms used are, the more efficiently can matter be converted into energy. In order to start the reactor, provide it with a large amount of electrical power, in a zero-G environment (in orbit) and preferably near a gravity well (planet).
		#LOC_KSPIE_KspiQuantumSingulaityReactor2_tags = quantum singularity reactor blackhole energy
		#LOC_KSPIE_KspiTriAlphaFusionReactor_title = Tri Alpha Colliding Beam Fusion Reactor
		#LOC_KSPIE_KspiTriAlphaFusionReactor_manuf = Keridian Dynamics
		#LOC_KSPIE_KspiTriAlphaFusionReactor_descr = The Tri Alpha Colliding Beam Fusion Reactor is the first fusion reactor capable of operating in aneutronic fusion mode and thanks to its integrated direct energy converter can operate at high efficiencies. This will be ideal for electric propulsion where waste heat should be minimised. This comes however at the cost of flexibility, as the reactor will not be able to connect with any thermal or magnetic nozzles and can only run with aneutronic fusion fuels.
		#LOC_KSPIE_WarpDrive_title = Alcubierre Drive (Light) 
		#LOC_KSPIE_WarpDrive_manuf = Zefram Kerman's Warp Supplies Co.
		#LOC_KSPIE_WarpDrive_descr = Originally designed by Zefram Kerman himself, this piece of technology is designed to sneakily evade the prohibition of faster than light travel described by the theory of relativity by translating a small subset of spacetime across space at unbelievable speeds while imparting no momentum change to the vessel at all.  Since it was designed by Zefram Kerman, it may not function without the application of rock music.
