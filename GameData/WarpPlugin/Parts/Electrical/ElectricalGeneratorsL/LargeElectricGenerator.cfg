description = A Charged Particle Direct Power Converter is a type of Electric Generator engine that convert charged particles directly into electrical power. It needs to be connected directly to a reactor to function. Initially it will allow you to convert charged particles at a flat efficiency of 70%, independent of wasteheat ratio. Unlocking more advanced electric technology allows improved performance up to 90% efficiency significantly reducing the amount of produced wasteheat.
Note that some reactor have a build in Direct Charged Article Converter
