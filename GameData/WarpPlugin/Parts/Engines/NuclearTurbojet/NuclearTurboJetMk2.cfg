	manufacturer = PorkWorks
	description = Similar to a chemical Turbojet, except the combustion chamber has been replaced by a nuclear reactor heating the air and driving the turbine. Since it does not rely on chemical combustion, flight time is unlimited and the engine will work in oxygenless atmospheres. The only downside is the mass added by the heavy reactor shielding. It includes an build in precooler and air intakes.
