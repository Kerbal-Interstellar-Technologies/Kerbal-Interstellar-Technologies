	description = Engineers at N5 relized, after crashing multiple uncrewed prototypes that they just couldn't get away with not making a huge engine for huge parts. Faced with the need to lift heavy spaceplanes and get them to high speed, they developed this hybrid engine which works as a high-bypass turbofan for low speeds, gaining thrust quickly, and as a ramjet for high speed, for better supersonic performance. All this, of course at the cost of some fuel efficiency.
