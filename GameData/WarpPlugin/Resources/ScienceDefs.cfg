		EuropaInSpaceLowCrosscutPlains = Traces of numerous sulfur compounds are detected in scans of this area, possibly giving it a slightly darker color.
		EuropaInSpaceLowLineaments = Analysis of Europa's dark lines reveal mostly water ice, with slightly higher concentrations of salts and silicates than are found elsewhere on the surface.
		EuropaInSpaceLowCraters = High levels of silicate minerals are detected here, most likely the remains of the asteroid that made this crater.
		GanymedeInSpaceLow = Scans of Ganymede's surface reveal a mix of water ice, silicate compounds, along with traces of some organic compounds.
		GanymedeInSpaceLowLowlands = A number of organic compounds are detected in scans of this area, most likely seeded here by asteroid impacts.

		GanymedeInSpaceLowPoles = The surface here appears to be mostly composed of water ice frost, easily vaporized by the laser.
		GanymedeInSpaceLowCraters = Very high concentrations of iron, nickel, and titanium are detected in scans of these craters, suggesting that they are the result of very dense asteroids.
		CallistoInSpaceLow = Signs of water ice are found covering most of the surface of Callisto.
		CallistoInSpaceLowCrateredMidlands = The surface here has patches of nearly pure water ice mixed in with more rocky, silicate-rich terrain.
		CallistoInSpaceLowAsgardCrater = Laser scans of the surface in this enormous basin show very high concentrations of water ice.
		CallistoInSpaceLowOldCraters = Along with the water ice common to Callisto's surface, signs of ammonia and methane ice are also found.
		TitanInSpaceLow = The laser vaporizes a sample of Titan's surface, producing a brownish cloud of energetic dust.
		TitanInSpaceLowMidlands = Laser ablation of the soil in this region reveals relatively low concentrations of the hydrocarbons common across most of Titan's surface.

		AsteroidInSpaceLowStony = This lightweight, stony asteroid is made up primarily of silicates, with only trace levels of iron and nickel detected.
		AsteroidInSpaceLowIcy-Organic = Several spikes in calcium and aluminum content are detected. This indicates the presence of tiny chondrules that could date from the birth of the Kerbol system.
		AsteroidInSpaceLowCarbonaceous = High levels of water are detected in this asteroid, among the silicates and sulfides. These signs indicate that this is likely to be a carbonaceous chondrite type of asteroid.
		AsteroidInSpaceLowCarbonaceous = A number of organic compounds are vaporized by the laser, suggesting that this is a carbonaceous asteroid.
		AsteroidInSpaceLowCarbonaceous = The presence of several types of organic polymers along with the iron compound magnetite suggest that this is a relatively rare B-type, carbonaceous asteroid.
		AsteroidInSpaceLowIcy-Organic = High levels of water and silicate minerals are detected in scans of this asteroid.
		AsteroidInSpaceLowComet = The surface content of this comet suggests that its interior is composed almost entirely of water ice.
		AsteroidInSpaceLowStony = The surface of this asteroid appears to be composed primarily of various silicates.
		AsteroidInSpaceLowStony = Scans indicate that this is a stony asteroid, given the high concentrations of iron- and magnesium-silicates.
		AsteroidInSpaceLowCarbonaceous = High concentrations of various organic compounds are detected in this dark asteroid.
		AsteroidInSpaceLowMetallic = Scans of the surface indicated mostly basaltic minerals, but traces of some heavier metals indicated that this asteroid may have a small, but distinct, metallic core.
		AsteroidInSpaceLowMetallic = The high concentrations of iron, nickel, and cobalt indicate that this is a metallic asteroid, possibly generated in the breakup of some ancient planetoid.
		AsteroidInSpaceLowMetallic = Among the high concentrations of iron and nickel in this metallic asteroid are several indications of various heavy metals, making this a tempting target for orbital strip-mining.
