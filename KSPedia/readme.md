# KSP Interstellar Extended - The KSPedia

## How can I contribute?

This KSPedia project uses Unity 5.4.0f3 (personal) with the KSP Part Tools suite.
To get started understanding how the KSPedia works, a [fantastic tutorial by DMagic](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/137628-kspedia-creation-tutorial/) exists on the KSP forums.
This rework of the KSPI-E KSPedia would not exist without that tutorial.

Secondly, the current designer of the rework isn't exactly a graphic designer; any aid in improving the visual resources would be highly appreciated.
